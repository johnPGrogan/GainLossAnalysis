# GainLossAnalysis
Matlab scripts to analyse the GainLoss data.
Please cite this as: Grogan, J.P. (2018). GainLossAnalysis. Github. https://github.com/johnPGrogan/GainLossAnalysis/releases/tag/v1.0

This code works with the data that can be found here https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.qpqzeqc3q53m2dwczp69q3pv0

If you put this folder in the same one that contains GainLossDataRelease, then the paths should work. If not, you may need to edit the paths in GLDataLoad.m and GLDataProcess.m

The whole pipeline can be run by running GainLossAnalysis.m. It will load the data from GainLossDataRelease, process and analyse it, and produce versions of the main figures from the paper (Grogan et al., 2018, in submission).

This code requires MATLAB, and was run in version r2016.
